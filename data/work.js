One of the hardest things I've done and a proud personal accomplishment. I documented it in <a href='https://www.lkk-store.com/lkk-map'>a couple of interactive graphics</a>. I also created a print map for it <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci7tPXevSzo/'>together with a designer friend</a>. I did everything from sourcing the fabric to working with a local family shop to do the <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci-HbL9AJAZ/'>silk screen printing</a>. It was an all new learning experience for me. Together with a local brand Hakdim, we sold over 200 copies of the maps. Thank you to everyone who helped make this a reality.","did":"Hiking! mapping, writing, design and development, launching a physical product","vidlink":"","date":"Summer 2022"},{"hide":"","title":"Hiking the Via Alpina","link":"https://www.lkk-store.com/lkk-map/a/stories/via-alpina/","imglink":"viaalpina","pub":"Personal","description":"In the fall of 2021, I hiked across Switzerland on the Via Alpina.

We even ran into a snowstorm at 2,700 meters, not knowing whether we would make it. It was rough, but somehow we made it from one end of Switzerland to the other.","did":"Hiking! mapping, writing, design and development","vidlink":"","date":"Oct. 2021"},{"hide":"","title":"LKK Store","link":"https://www.lkk-store.com/","imglink":"lkk","pub":"Personal","description":"My partner and I started selling silkscreen printed tshirts as a side hustle.
